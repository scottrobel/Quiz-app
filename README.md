# Quiz App

I was given the following assignment when applying to my current job.
```Description
This is a web/Rails-based Quiz app that allows an administrator to create a Quiz with a series of questions and then allow other users to take the quiz and collect their answers. Think of it like a lightweight Google Forms.
The app should support
User registration and authentication
regular users
administrative users
Admin quiz management
manage quizzes
add questions to a quiz
edit questions
view quiz responses / users
Multiple Question types (free text, choose-one, choose-multiple)
Quiz taking: a user can take a quiz and submit their answers
‌
‌
Personally, I would say don’t bother with tests. I’d rather see the app come to life then get bogged down in testing. It’s totally your call though. If you prefer “test driven development” and thats your thing - then go for it!
‌
**
Deployment
The app will be deployed to Heroku. It can use the free tier services.
All information will be stored in a SQL (Postgres) database.```
